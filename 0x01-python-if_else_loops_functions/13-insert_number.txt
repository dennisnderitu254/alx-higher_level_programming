ALGORITHM

Let input linked list is sorted in increasing order

1) If Linked list is empty then make the node as
   head and return it.

2) If the value of the node to be inserted is smaller 
   than the value of the head node, then insert the node 
   at the start and make it head.

3) In a loop, find the appropriate node after 
   which the input node (let 9) is to be inserted. 
   To find the appropriate node start from the head, 
   keep moving until you reach a node GN (10 in
   the below diagram) who's value is greater than 
   the input node. The node just before GN is the
   appropriate node (7).

4) Insert the node (9) after the appropriate node
   (7) found in step 3.


Complexity Analysis: 

Time Complexity: O(n) - Only one traversal of the list is needed.
Auxiliary Space: O(1) - No extra space is needed.
